# Afterman Software Unit Testing Framework

AS-Test is a framework for easily developing tests and doing result validations.  This library evolved from a desire to simplify our code base and 
to cut down on the amount of boilerplate code we had in our unit test projects.  AS-Test prefers [Behavior Driven Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd/) where applicable and implements a [Given-When-Then](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/gwt/) style.  However, AS-Test also has components to support any testing style.
